# Boggle

## Program information

This program allows the user to play Boggle in a GUI. The player first selects their desired tray size (either 4x4 or 5x5). Then, the player has 3 minutes to select as many words as they can.

The game is initialized in Main, where the game manager and GUI window are created. Most of the game mechanics are handled in the GUI controller but all objects are stored in the game manager.

Instructions listed in the tutorial screen:  
*Find words of at least (3) letters long  
*Enter as many as you can until the timer runs out  
*Click a tray size to begin!  

## Debugging Options
